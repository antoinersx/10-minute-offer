Perfect! Let me now provide a comprehensive status report.

## STATUS REPORT

**STATUS:** working

**COMPLETED:**
I've successfully implemented the core generation functionality for the 10 Minute Offer SaaS application. Here's what was built:

### 1. API Endpoints
- **`/api/generate-offer`** - Main generation endpoint with:
  - Context file loading (Hormozi & Brunson frameworks)
  - Sequential document generation (all 7 documents)
  - Exponential backoff retry logic (max 3 attempts)
  - Background processing to avoid timeouts
  - Partial progress saving if generation fails mid-sequence
  
- **`/api/projects`** - Project CRUD operations:
  - GET: Fetch user's projects
  - POST: Create new project

### 2. Dashboard UI
- **Project List Page** (`/dashboard`):
  - Display all user projects with status badges
  - Empty state for new users
  - Project cards showing name, description, status, creation date
  - Responsive grid layout
  
- **Project Creation Modal**:
  - Form with project name, business description, target avatar
  - Deep research toggle
  - Validation and error handling

### 3. Project Detail Page (`/dashboard/projects/[id]`)
- **Generate Button Component**:
  - Status-aware (disabled when generating/complete)
  - Loading states
  - Auto-refresh polling every 3 seconds during generation
  
- **Document List Component**:
  - All 7 documents displayed in order (03, 04, 05, 06, 07, 10, 14)
  - Status icons (pending, generating, complete)
  - Expandable document viewer with markdown rendering
  - Progress indicator during generation

### 4. Generation Logic
- Documents generated in sequence with proper dependencies:
  1. Market Research (03)
  2. Complete Avatar (04) - references market research
  3. Big Idea (05) - references avatar
  4. Value Ladder (06) - references big idea
  5. Avatar Validation (07) - cross-references market research & avatar
  6. Landing Page Copy (10) - references avatar, big idea, value ladder
  7. Implementation Checklist (14) - references value ladder & landing page

- Each document loads dependencies from previously generated documents
- Web search enabled when deep research is toggled on

### 5. Error Handling & Resilience
- Retry logic with exponential backoff (1s, 2s, 4s delays)
- Partial status if generation fails mid-sequence
- Failed status for complete failures
- Error messages stored in generations table
- Duration tracking for analytics

### Files Created/Modified:
- `app/api/generate-offer/route.ts` (NEW)
- `app/api/projects/route.ts` (NEW)
- `app/dashboard/page.tsx` (MODIFIED)
- `app/dashboard/CreateProjectButton.tsx` (NEW)
- `app/dashboard/projects/[id]/page.tsx` (NEW)
- `app/dashboard/projects/[id]/GenerateButton.tsx` (NEW)
- `app/dashboard/projects/[id]/DocumentList.tsx` (NEW)
- `@fix_plan.md` (UPDATED - marked 17 tasks complete)

**VERIFICATION:**
- ✅ TypeScript compilation passes
- ✅ Next.js build succeeds
- ✅ All routes properly configured
- ✅ Database schema properly utilized

**NEXT:**
The highest priority remaining uncompleted task is implementing PDF export functionality. This includes:
1. Single document PDF export with clean formatting
2. Full package ZIP export bundling all 7 PDFs

This would require adding:
- A PDF generation library (e.g., `@react-pdf/renderer` or `puppeteer`)
- `/api/export/pdf/[documentId]` endpoint
- `/api/export/zip/[projectId]` endpoint
- Download buttons in the UI

**EXIT_SIGNAL:** false

The core generation engine is complete and functional. Users can now:
1. Create projects with business details
2. Generate complete offer packages (7 documents)
3. View generated documents with proper markdown rendering
4. Track generation progress in real-time

Next iteration should focus on PDF export capabilities to make the generated content truly portable and professional.
