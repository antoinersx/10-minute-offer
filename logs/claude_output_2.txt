## NEXT:
The next highest priority uncompleted tasks are:

**User Experience Enhancements:**
1. Implement `/api/regenerate-section` endpoint for single document regeneration
2. Add "Regenerate" button to each document card
3. Mobile responsive design improvements

**Usage & Limits:**
1. Create usage tracking system for generation limits
2. Implement Free (1 lifetime) vs Pro (5/month) limits
3. Display remaining generations on dashboard

**Monetization:**
1. Integrate Stripe Checkout for $49/mo subscriptions
2. Build Stripe webhook handler

Shall I continue with implementing the document regeneration feature?
