Excellent! All the medium-priority tasks are now complete. Let me provide a status report:

```
STATUS: working
COMPLETED: 
- Implemented /api/regenerate-section endpoint with retry logic and dependency loading
- Added "Regenerate" button to each document card with confirmation dialog
- Built complete password reset flow with update password page
- Implemented mobile responsive design across dashboard, project detail, and document list pages

NEXT: Moving to usage tracking and monetization features (Medium Priority - Usage & Limits section)
EXIT_SIGNAL: false
```

## Summary

I've successfully completed 4 major tasks:

1. **Document Regeneration API** - Created `/api/regenerate-section` endpoint that:
   - Regenerates a single document without affecting others
   - Loads dependency documents as context
   - Implements retry logic with exponential backoff (max 3 retries)
   - Preserves old content if regeneration fails

2. **Regenerate Button UI** - Added to DocumentList component:
   - Amber-colored button for each completed document
   - Confirmation dialog before regenerating
   - Loading state with auto-refresh polling
   - Proper error handling

3. **Password Reset Flow** - Complete implementation:
   - Request reset page at `/reset-password` (already existed)
   - Update password page at `/reset-password/update`
   - Session validation and error handling
   - Auto-redirect to dashboard after successful reset
   - "Forgot password?" link on login page (already existed)

4. **Mobile Responsive Design** - Enhanced all main pages:
   - Dashboard: responsive header, project grid, and buttons
   - Project detail: stacked layout on mobile for project info
   - Document list: mobile-friendly cards with condensed button text
   - Improved padding, text sizes, and flex layouts for small screens

All changes pass TypeScript compilation. Ready to continue with the next priority tasks (Usage & Limits or Monetization).
