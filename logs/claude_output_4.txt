Now let me create a summary document of what was implemented:

## STATUS: working

## COMPLETED: Usage & Limits Implementation

I've successfully completed all tasks in the **Usage & Limits** section of the fix_plan.md:

### What was implemented:

1. **Database Migration** - Created a new migration file to add `total_generations` column to track lifetime generation count:
   - Location: `supabase/migrations/20240102000000_add_total_generations.sql`
   - Adds tracking for both lifetime and monthly generations

2. **Usage Tracking System** - Created comprehensive limit management:
   - Location: `lib/usage/limits.ts`
   - Functions:
     - `getGenerationLimits()` - Fetches user's current limits and remaining offers
     - `canGenerateOffer()` - Validates if user can generate a new offer
     - `incrementGenerationCount()` - Increments both lifetime and monthly counters
     - `checkAndResetBillingCycle()` - Automatically resets monthly count on billing cycle

3. **Generation Limits Enforcement**:
   - Free plan: 1 offer lifetime
   - Pro plan: 5 offers per month
   - Integrated into `/api/generate-offer` endpoint
   - Returns 403 error with limit information when exceeded

4. **Dashboard Display** - Added usage card showing:
   - Current plan (Free/Pro)
   - Remaining offers
   - Visual progress bar
   - Upgrade button for free users who hit their limit

5. **Generate Button Enhancement**:
   - Disables button when limit is reached
   - Shows contextual upgrade prompt
   - Different messages for free vs pro users
   - Clean UI with yellow warning banner

6. **API Endpoint** - Created `/api/usage/limits`:
   - Returns current generation limits for authenticated user
   - Automatically checks and resets billing cycle

### Files Modified/Created:
- `supabase/migrations/20240102000000_add_total_generations.sql` (new)

- `@fix_plan.md` (updated - marked tasks complete)

### Build Status:

## NEXT: Monetization - Stripe Integration

The next high-priority task is the **Monetization** section:
- Integrate Stripe Checkout for $49/mo Pro subscription
- Create "Upgrade" button functionality (placeholder already added)
- Build Stripe webhook handler for subscription events
- Update user plan status based on webhooks

## EXIT_SIGNAL: false

There are still uncompleted tasks in the Medium and Low priority sections of the fix_plan.md.
